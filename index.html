        After graduation of university in 2020 I was working as a logistic in a transport company. In the beginning of 2022, I decided to change my sphere of activity. In March I started the Skillbox Python Development course and completed this course in August. During the learning in Skillbox I was able to implement pet-project(similar to twitter). In RS-School I want to get knowledge about front-end development.
